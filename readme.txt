This isn't meant to be used for anything practical. Just some cryptological silliness designed for decrypting and encrypting really unsecure files or passwords.
V1 tries to brute force its way in by trying a few million combinations. Will solve any four digit password.
V2 searches from a list of 8700 most common passwords and compares them to the original string. Also checks to see if integers may be added on at the end.
Encrypt does a really simple encryption algorithm that I wouldn't reccomend you use if you want your files to actually be safe.
